      <p>
        Origami is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with
        Japanese culture. In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an
        inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of
        origin. The goal is to transform a flat square sheet of paper into a
        finished sculpture through folding and sculpting techniques. Modern
        origami practitioners generally discourage the use of cuts, glue, or
        markings on the paper. Origami folders often use the Japanese word
        kirigami to refer to designs which use cuts.
